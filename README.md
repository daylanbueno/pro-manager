# ProManager

ProManager is a user-friendly web application for managing products, built with the Spring Framework. 
It allows users to list, add, edit, and delete products, featuring a product table with columns like name, description, price, category path, and availability.
ProManager supports sorting and filtering products for better user experience. The application uses JPA/ORM for database operations and Spring MVC for web development. Secure access is provided by Spring Security,
with a super user role for complete administrative control.
The database schema efficiently stores products and categories, allowing easy retrieval of full category paths.
